**Sudoku Application**
  
	This project is an iOS sudoku game application that features: data 
	persistence, auto layout for the UI, cell conflict highlighting, and menu 
	features for usability such as: new easy/hard game, clear conflicting cells, 
	clear non-fixed cells, and clear all pencils. A 'victory' alert will pop up
	when the user successfully completes the puzzle, offering them to start a 
	new easy or hard game.
  
  
**Description**: 

         The goal of this project is to implement an iOS app for a sudoku 
         puzzle game. Core Graphics was used to respond to finger taps to enable
         the user to interact with the puzzle. A heirarchy of views was 
         implemented to manage the possible device orientations. The MVC 
         paradigm was followed in order to complete this project.
